            <li>To create a more interactive UI design some transorm and transition properties were added.</li>
            <li>The Github and Linkedin links will grow both left and right while keeping the text centered using a transition technique is css. </li>
            <li>Using hover:hover allows the user to not get these effects on smaller devices that dont have a mouse to hover over. This avoided any bad UI implications.</li>

    <h3>Problem:</h3>
    <li>When I was trying to make my website responive on a tablet i had problems lining the 3 divs for the main section in a line verticaly.</li>

   <h3>Problem:</h3>
    <li>I had issue lining up the logo on the header with smaller devices because of the large text size.</li>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <li>I fixed this by moving all the font awsome onto a new line to keep it space apropriatly with my name.</li>
    <h3>Problem:</h3>
    <li>When using the site on a mobile device i noticed that when the github and linkedin links were clicked and I returned to the site they would permanently have changed there properties because of the trasition.</li>
