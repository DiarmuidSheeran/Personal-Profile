    <li><h2>Transform and Transition Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To create a more interactive UI design some transorm and transition properties were added.</li>
            <li>The Github and Linkedin links will grow both left and right while keeping the text centered using a transition technique is css. </li>
            <li>Using hover:hover allows the user to not get these effects on smaller devices that dont have a mouse to hover over. This avoided any bad UI implications.</li>
