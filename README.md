# Diamruid Sheeran's Personal Profile
This is a personal profile website for me (Diarmuid Sheeran) to showcase some of my skills in a static HTML/CSS website.

The aim of the website is to give the user a brief introduction to what I am currently studying and what I hope to achieve.

It will give the user an oppertunity to download my CV.

It will also give the user an oppertunity to leave feedback to help me improve my site.

* All navigation is clealry named sized and styled for ease of use while navigating throught the site.


### Download Button

* The purpose of the download button is to allow a user to download a copy my CV.
* I added a download link to a pdf file i saved in a folder called data.
* The download button was made large to emphasise the purpose of the download page and entice the user to download a copy of my CV.
* The download button changes it's properties when hovered over and the mouse cursor is changed to a pointer.

### Feedback Form

* The feedback form allows the user to input their name, email and write in a text area to submit feedback on my work.
* There are 3 standered text input fields with 1 larger text area field
* There is a submit button underneath the input fields that allows the user to submit the data they have entered.
* When the submit button is hovered over its properties change and the mouse changes to a pointer.

### Transform and Transition Properties

* To create a more interactive UI design some transorm and transition properties were added.
* The Github and Linkedin links will grow both left and right while keeping the text centered using a transition technique is css.
* Using hover:hover allows the user to not get these effects on smaller devices that dont have a mouse to hover over. This avoided any bad UI implications.

* When the page loads the about me section floats into position before doing a full 360 degree flip.
* This is achived by using keyframe, transform and translate3d in css.
* The aim of this is to instantly engage the user and create intreague about the site.
* Click the gif below for a demonstration.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

#### Problem:
* When I was trying to make my website responive on a tablet i had problems lining the 3 divs for the main section in a line verticaly.
#### Solution:
* I figured out that by changing the width from 33% of the screen to 100% fixed the issue
#### Problem:
* I had issue lining up the logo on the header with smaller devices because of the large text size.
#### Solution:
* I fixed this by moving all the font awsome onto a new line to keep it space apropriatly with my name.
#### Problem:
* When using the site on a mobile device i noticed that when the github and linkedin links were clicked and I returned to the site they would permanently have changed there properties because of the trasition.
#### Solution:
* I fixed this by adding the hover:hover syntax to make sure this feature was only availble on devices with the capabilities of hovering.
